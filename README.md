# summer24---Book-Recommendation-System

This project was inspired when I had finished a couple books this summer, and was a little stumped on what I should read next. As a result I thought it'd be a great idea to make a recommendation system for a book of your choice!

The tech that was used for this project was: python, pandas, and sklearn

I was able to learn more about cosine similarities, and how to utilize them effectively for my needds in this specific project!
